# Practicing XML/DTD/XSD/XSL
Some exercises I did for the Web Engineering class to prepare for Code Reviews/ practice what we did in class.

## xml_dtd
A small exercise linking a `blog.xml` file to a `blog.dtd` file, based on info found in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd_intro.asp).

## xml_xsd
The same small exercise as before, but this time linking a `blog.xml` file to a `blog.xsd` file, based on info found in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp).
