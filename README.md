# Practicing XML/DTD/XSD/XSL
Some exercises I did for the Web Engineering class to prepare for Code Reviews/ practice what we did in class.

## xml_dtd
A small exercise linking a `blog.xml` file to a `blog.dtd` file, based on info found in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd_intro.asp).

## xml_xsd
The same small exercise as before, but this time linking a `blog.xml` file to a `blog.xsd` file, based on info found in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp). 

## xml_xsl
Present the `blog.xml` file on the browser by linking it to a `blog.xsl` file and making some small style changes (adding a background)

## final_exercise
Taking what I've learned through the other exercises, I made a `coffee_types.xml` file that describes different types of coffees and how to prepare them. It also includes a rating per coffee. A `coffee_types.xsd` file was also part of the exercise, which i used to validate the `coffee_types.xml` file (see commented line there), but the final version is linked to a `coffee_types.xsl` file to display the content in html, with some light styling added.
